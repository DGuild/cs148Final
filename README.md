This was a final project for my Database Design for the web class. It was a partner project, so my partner and I made a simple
news site, with the idea that anyone could submit or edit a news story. The UI is nothing special, but the goal was to practice
developing a site that could interact with a database in multiple ways (i.e using all CRUD commands).
